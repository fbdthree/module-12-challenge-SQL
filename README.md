The Employee Tracker is a back-end application, written in JavaScript.  The Employee Tracker requires `Inquirer`, `MySQL2`, and the `console.table` modules to imported to the applications in order to function, and needs `NodeJS` to be installed in order for the application to run in the terminal

The easy-to-use interface simply asks the user a series of questions, and the application will act according to the user’s input.  The user has the ability to view all department, roles, and employees, add a department, role, and employee, and to update an employee’s role.
